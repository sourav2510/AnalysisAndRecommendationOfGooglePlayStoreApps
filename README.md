# Analysis and Recommendation of Google Play Store Apps using metadata

## Predict App Success on the Google Play Store using Machine Learning - Decision Trees

Dataset: Kaggle Google Play Store Apps : https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps

In the Python Notebook, the Play Store Apps Dataset, taken from Kaggle, is analysed with various Plots and Conclusions. 
The Dataset has data about more than 10,000 apps in the Store.

## Objectives:
In this project, we analysed Google Play Store that provides a wide range of data on ratings, reviews, price, category, size, number of installs and descriptions of apps. 
The objective of this analysis is to provide an insight of the overall app store in order to analyse the trending apps and to recommend it accordingly. 
We have determined which category has the maximum number of apps, how many apps are of full rating, which are the most reviewed apps in the store, what is the percentage of free versus paid apps, which one is the most common app category and rating, etc. 
Main objective is to provide an effective and well analysed recommendation system of google play store to the users.

Google Play Store Apps Dataset Analysis

Important Conclusions from the Analysis are:

        Most of the Apps hold a rating of above 4.0 easily.
        The most famous Apps like WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram are the most reviewed Apps.
        93% of the Apps are free in the Play Store.

## Research Questions: 

1. Can you predict an app's popularity on the Google Play Store using a Decision Tree?
2. If a developer were to create a new app, what qualities should this app have in order to generate the most ad revenue?

## Results
On fitting the decision tree classifier on the dataset, we got an accuracy of about 71.5.
